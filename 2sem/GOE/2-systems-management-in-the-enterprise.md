## Frameworks for IT Service Management
### Information Technology Infrastructure (ITIL)
- ITIL is a set of best practices and guidelines for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of the business even when they change
- Primarily adresses the management of IT services and infrastructure
- Principles and processes can be applied to various aspects of IT operations. including the management of legacy data and code
- By adhering to 7 core principles, organizations can structure their IT service management processes in a way that maximizes value, minimizes risk and supports business objectives
	- Designed to ensure that IT services are aligned with the needs of the business and delivered efficiently and effectively

## 7 Principles of ITIL
1. **Focus on Value** - the primary focus of ITIL is on delivering value to the business and its customers. This involves understanding the needs and requirements of stakeholders and ensuring that IT services support business objectives and outcomes
2. **Start Where You Are** - it emphasizes the importance of taking a practical and incremental approach to process improvements. Organizations should assess their current state, identify areas for improvements and prioritize changes based on their impact and feasibility
3. **Progress Iteratively with Feedback** - it encourages organizations to adopt and iterative approach to process improvement, where changes are implemented incrementally and feedback is used to guide further improvements. This approach helps managing risks and ensures that changes are aligned with business needs
4. **Collaborate and Promote Visibility** - effective collaboration and communication are essential for successful IT service management. ITIL promotes collaboration between different teams and departments involved in delivering and supporting IT services. It also emphasizes the importance of promoting visibility and transparency, so that stakeholders have access to relevant information and can make informed decisions
5. **Think and Work Holistically** - it encourages organizations to make a holistic view of IT service management, considering the end-to-end service lifecycle and the interdependencies between different processes and activities. This approach helps ensuring that changes are implemented in a coordinated and integrated manner, rather than in isolation
6. **Keep It Simple and Practical** - it advocates for simplicity and practicality in the design and implementation of IT service management processes. Processes should be easy to understand, use and maintain, and should be tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the organization
7. **Optimize and Automate** - continuous improvement is a key principle of ITIL, and organizations should strive to optimize and automate their IT service management processes wherever possible. This includes identifying opportunities to streamline workflows, eliminate waste and leverage technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness

#### ITIL Services
- **Service Strategy** - emphasizes understanding the business objectives and defining the services required to support those objectives
- **Service Design** - focuses on designing efficient and effective IT services and processes
- **Service Transition** - involves transitioning new or modified services into production while minimizing disruption to the business
- **Service Operation** - focuses on delivering and supporting IT services effectively and efficiently
- **Continual Service Improvement (CSI)** - emphasizes the need for ongoing evaluation and improvement of IT services and processes

#### ITIL Management
- **Change Management** - helps organizations manage changes to IT services and infrastructure in a controlled and transparent manner
- **Configuration Management** - involves managing configuration items (CIs) and their relationships to support effective change management and service delivery

> By applying ITIL principles and practices to the management of legacy data and code, organizations can **improve the efficiency, reliability and agility of their IT operations while minimizing risks and ensuring alignment with business objectives**

### An ITIL Best Practice Example for Service Transition
- **Implement a comprehensive change management process**
- **Change management** ensures that changes to the IT environment are planned, assessed, authorized and implemented with minimal disruption
- **Key Steps:**
	1. **Establish a Change Advisory Board (CAB)**
	    - Include stakeholders from IT, operations, security, and business units
	    - CAB reviews and approves all proposed changes based on impact, risk and business alignemnt
	2. **Define Change Categories**
	    - **Standard changes** – low risk, pre-approved
	    - **Normal changes** – require CAB approval
	    - **Emergency changes** – implemented urgently to resolve critical issues
	3. **Create a Change Management Policy**
	    - Define procedures for:
	        - Requesting changes
	        - Assessing and prioritizing
	        - Roles and responsibilities
	        - Communication and escalation
	4. **Implement a Change Request Process**
	    - Use standardized forms including:
	        - Change description
	        - Risk assessment
	        - Rollback plan
	        - Implementation schedule
	    - Ensure all changes are logged and tracked
	5. **Perform Impact and Risk Assessment**
	    - Analyze effects on:
	        - Services
	        - Infrastructure
	        - Stakeholders 
	    - Consider:
	        - Potential disruptions
	        - Dependencies
	        - Compliance needs   
	6. **Review and Approval**
	    - CAB evaluates based on:
	        - Impact
	        - Urgency
	        - Cost
	        - Strategic alignment
	    - Document and communicate approvals
	7. **Coordinate Implementation**
	    - Allocate appropriate resources
	    - Schedule during:
	        - Maintenance windows
	        - Low-impact periods
	    - Take precautions to minimize disruption
	8. **Monitor and Review**
	    - Monitor during and after implementation
	    - Conduct post-implementation reviews:
	        - Evaluate success
	        - Identify improvements
