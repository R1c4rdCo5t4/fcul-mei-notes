# Introduction

## Business Development

### Traditional View
- **Key Areas:**
	- **Business Strategy**: business structure, value proposition, value generation
	- **Services**: processes, users, user stories, information needs
	- **Technology**: detailed design, frontend and backend development
- **Challenges:**
	- Lack of communication
	- Different languages
	- Technical debt
	- Change problems

### Modern View
- **Key Focus Areas:**
	- **Technology**: digital transformation, productivity, big data, AI, automation
	- **Services**: communication, collaboration, community, cloud, mobile
	- **Business Strategy**: digital business models
- **New Roles:**
	- **Tech Leads**: first responders, data insights, contextualization
	- **Domain Experts**: trial-and-error, user feedback, co-design
	- **Facilitators**: agility, flexibility, explore-exploit cycles

### Cultural Shifts in Business
- **Traditional Business** → **Digital Business**
	- Business-driven → Opportunity-driven
	- Technology-driven → Co-design, community
	- Planning-based → Trial-and-error

## Software Development
### Traditional Development
- **Phases:** Plan → Analyze → Design → Develop → Test → Operate
- **Stakeholders:** managers, business analysts, developers, IT
- **Cycle Time:** years
- **Challenges:**
	- Red tape
	- Siloed teams
	- Communication problems
	- Lack of flexibility & agility

### Agile Development
- **Key Elements:**
	- **Sprints**
	- **Product Increments (Integration)**
	- **Operations**
	- **Planning (Product Backlog)**
- **Teams:** Agile/Scrum teams, Scrum Masters, IT, Product Owners
- **Cycle Time:** Weeks
- **Challenges:**
	- Top-down pressure
	- Scaling up projects
	- Dependencies
	- Divergent priorities

### Continuous Development (DevOps)
- **Cycle Time:** hours/minutes
- **Key Aspects:**
	- **Features Team**: value proposition, features mapping, dependency management
	- **DevOps Team**: continuous development, integration, deployment, monitoring
- **Challenges:** alignment, collaboration, strategizing

### Continuous Everything (BizDevOps)
- **Key Aspects:**
	- Continuous alignment
	- Continuous release
	- Continuous monitoring
- **Cultural Shifts in Development**
	- Plan & analyze → Agile, flexible teams
	- Documentation-heavy → No documentation
	- Incrementalism → Continuous pace
	- Self-management → Full autonomy & collaboration

## Systems Design
### Evolution of System Architectures
1. **Monolithic (On-Premise)**
	- Single large components
2. **Client-Server Systems**
	- **Frontend:** user-facing functionality
	- **Backend:** processing & resources
3. **Enterprise Distributed Systems**
	- Tiered architecture
4. **Mesh, Multi-tiered, Serverless Systems**
	- Single responsibilities
5. **Microservices & Micro-frontends**
	- Decentralized services, scalable

### Architectural Shifts
- Monolith → microservices, micro-frontends
- Server-based → serverless, distributed systems

## Integrated View
- **Software Development**, **Business Development** and **Systems Design** must align
- **Trends:**
	- Serverless architecture
	- Microservices & micro-frontends
	- Continuous delivery
	- Change, emergence, agility, flexibility
	- Trial-and-error approaches

## Conclusion
- **Modern business and software development require cultural shifts:**
	- From **rigid, hierarchical structures** to **agile, community-driven approaches**
	- From **monolithic architectures** to **microservices & serverless models**
	- From **long planning cycles** to **continuous delivery and experimentation**
	- Netflix serves as a prime example of successful adaptation through digital transformation
