### Motivation
- The **industry average** is 15-50 errors per 1000 lines of code (LoC), but can be reduced to 0.5 in highly tested software
### Are there many vulnerabilities?
- **CVE Details**: [CVE Database](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
- **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**: 900+ vulnerability classes
- Most common vulnerabilities:
	- Buffer overflow
	- Cross-site scripting
	- SQL injection
	- ...
### Vulnerability Discovery
- **Undecidability**: Finding all runtime errors is theoretically undecidable
- Both **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** and **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** are needed
### Trinity of Trouble
1. **Complexity**
2. **Extensibility**
3. **Connectivity**
### Software Challenges
- **Complexity**: Large codebases lead to errors
- **Extensibility**: Dynamic modules and plugins add security risks
- **Connectivity**: Wide-reaching internet bugs and attacks
- **IoT**: Growing number of connected devices
- **AI**: While it accelerates code production, it doesn't improve security
### (Near) Future of Software
- More components, mobile code, wireless connections and distribution
- AI won't necessarily lead to more secure code
