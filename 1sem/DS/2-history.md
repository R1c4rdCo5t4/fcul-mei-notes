# Software Engineering

> *“to imply the need for software manufacture to be based on the types of theoretical foundations and practical disciplines that are traditional in the established branches of engineering”* \[M.Jackson2004]

Software Engineering generally refers to a collection of:
- **Management processes**
	- of projects, requirements or settings
	- to ensure that software development projects are completed on time, within budget, according to specifications
- **Software tools**
	- IDEs, version control systems, debugging tools, etc.
	- these choices can have a huge influence on productivity and code quality
- Design, implementation, testing, documentation... activities dedicated to **software production**
	- effective design is essential for building a software system that meets its intended requirements and is maintainable
	- documentation is crucial for understanding, maintaining and using software systems - it includes various types of documentation, such as technical specifications, user manuals, code comments and system architecture documentation

#### Why is the term **Engineering** used?
- It denotes the disciplined application of scientific and technological knowledge in the resolution of conflicting constraints to problems that are significant from a practical point of view
- Creating cost-effective solutions
	- for practical problems
	- applying scientific knowledge
	- building things
	- at the service of humanity
- It involves
	- making decisions with limited time, knowledge and resources
	- reconciling conflicting constraints

### Types of Design
- **Normal Design**
	- Involves solving familiar problems, with already existing solutions
	- Evolving by learning to avoid failures
	- There is an evolution of standard component structure
- **Radical Design**
	- Finding solutions to unfamiliar problems, new applications
	- To satisfy novel requirements

Normal design is associated with lower risk, cost, communication, maintenance and time taken to develop, compared to radical design.

### Engineering
- Most engineering disciplines capture, organize and share knowledge in order to simplify routing design tasks.
- Sharing solutions **allows problems to be solved and complex systems to be build by ordinary people**, not just virtuosos.
- Engineering is based on the codification of scientific knowledge about a problem area in such a way that this **knowledge can be used directly** to answer the questions that occur most frequently in practice.

### Software Engineering
Focuses on creating good solutions to computing and information processing problems, namely in producing software systems with **quality**, **on time and within budget**, **satisfying the needs of customers and users**, **by applying systematic and disciplined approaches to development and maintenance**.

#### Is Software an Engineering Discipline?
- Yes, because:
	- **software developers build machines**
	- **programs are often complex constructs**, demanding engineering-like disciplines
	- **software interacts with the world**, serving mankind by solving real world problems

#### Characteristics of Engineering
- **Limited time, knowledge and resources force decisions on tradeoffs** ↑
- **Best-codified knowledge, preferentially science, shapes design decisions** ∼
- **Reference materials make knowledge and experience available** ↓
- **Analysis of design predicts properties of implementation** ∼

We still lack a firm engineering basis for our field, and have been slow to codify our results into unified theories and practical reference material. We also need to develop techniques that help to provide cost-effective quality despite associated uncertainties.

> *“**Architects draw detailed plans** before a brick is laid or a nail is hammered. **Programmers and software engineers don’t.** Can this be why houses seldom collapse and programs often crash? **Blueprints help architects ensure that what they are planning to build will work.** **“Working” means more than not collapsing;** it means serving the required purpose. Architects and their clients use blueprints to understand what they are going to build before they start building it. **But few programmers write even a rough sketch of what their programs will do before they start coding.”*** - from *"Why We Should Build Software Like We Build Houses"* - L. Lamport, 2013
