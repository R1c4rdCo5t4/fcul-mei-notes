# Software Product Lines (SPL)
### Systematic Reuse in Software
- **Challenge**: Ad-hoc reuse is inconsistent and often inefficient, leading to high maintenance costs:
	- **Reuse libraries:** it **often takes longer** to locate these small pieces and integrate them into a system than it would to **build them from scratch**.
	- **Clone and own:** modifying an existent system adding what is missing, turning it into a new product, which then takes its own maintenance path separate from the original.
- **Solution**: Systematic reuse through SPL's.

##### Software Product Lines
- **Definition**: a set of software-intensive systems sharing a common, managed set of features, developed from core assets in a prescribed way.
- **Goal**: enable planned and profitable reuse by optimizing core assets for multiple products.
- **Core Assets**: artifacts or resources that is built to be used in the production of more than one product in a software product line
	- Include architectures, reusable software components, domain models, requirements, test plans, performance models, work plans, process descriptions, etc.
- **Benefits**:
	- Reduces time-to-market, cost and development effort.
	- Enhances quality and reliability.
	- Facilitates mass customization and rapid market entry.

### Tactics for SPL Implementation
##### Core Activities
- **Domain Engineering**:
	- Development of the core asset base (reusable artifacts)
	- Scope definition (what systems the SPL will cover).
	- Planning for asset reuse and variability.
-  **Application Engineering**:
	- Product development.
	- Integrating specific elements based on core assets and variability.
- **Management**:
	- Technical and organizational management involving the orchestration of the technical activities that take place in the development of core assets and product development; definition of the financing model; etc.

##### Variability Management
- **Definition**: postponing decisions to adapt systems to specific needs.
- **Components**:
	- **Variation point**: predefined location for product-specific changes.
	- **Variant**: the specific variation used at a variation point.
		- **Open variation points** allow variants to be defined at product level;
		- **Closed variation points** fix variants completely.
- Appears in elements with different natures: services, execution platforms, operating systems, UIs, qualities, target market, etc.

##### Feature Modeling
- **Definition**: structured approach to describe common and variable features of SPL products.
- **Elements**:
	- Hierarchical organization.
	- Mandatory and optional features.
	- Constraints (e.g., excludes/includes).

### SPL Architecture
- **Role**: defines the structure and specifies components for reuse.
- **Mechanisms for Variability**:
	- Inclusion/exclusion of elements.
	- Selection of different versions of components.
	- Parameterization (e.g., configuration files).
- Examples:
	- **Philips Televisions**: reuse in structure and components saved development cost and time.
	- **Linux Kernel**: over 12,000 configuration options allow extensive variability.

### Costs and Challenges
- **Requirements**: advanced analysis to balance commonality and variability.
- **Architecture**: designing for inherent variability demands expertise.
- **Components**: robust and extensible designs for adaptability.
- **Planning**: balancing initial investment with future returns.

### Why SPL Works
- **Reusability**: common requirements, architectures and test plans reduce redundant work.
- **Testing**: pre-existing test plans streamline product verification.
- **Improved Quality**: each product iteration benefits from defect elimination in predecessors.

### Summary
- **Software Product Lines** enable systematic reuse, improving productivity and quality while reducing costs.
- **SPL emphasizes planning, core asset development and effective variability management** to support scalable and flexible software development.
