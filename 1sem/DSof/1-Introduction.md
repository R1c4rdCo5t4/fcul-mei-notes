- Involves shaping the behavior of the software, determining how it will be perceived by users and its impact on the environment. 
- Focuses on **requirements analysis**, **project scoping** and **specification**. 
### Representation Design
- Focuses on selecting structures to realize conceptual design.
- Deals with **software architecture**, **module design** and **implementation**.
- Involves organizing the software into data structures, modules and components. 
### Architectural Design 
- Describes how the software is organized into components.
- Covers higher-level system structure and defines interactions between components. 
### Detailed Design 
- Specifies the desired behavior of individual components. 
- Focuses on low-level implementation details such as algorithms, data structures and module interfaces.
